This pattern has gained popularity in recent years, especially on social media platforms and content-heavy websites.</p><h2>How It Works</h2><p>As the user approaches the bottom of the page, new content is automatically loaded and appended to the existing content. This creates a seamless browsing experience, allowing users to consume large amounts of content without interruption.</p><h2>Benefits</h2><ul><li><strong>Increased user engagement:</strong> Users tend to spend more time on sites with infinite scroll, as it reduces the friction of clicking to the next page.</li><li><strong>Smooth browsing experience:</strong> The continuous flow of content creates a more immersive and fluid interaction.</li><li><strong>Reduced interaction cost:</strong> Users don't need to make decisions about navigating to the next page, which can lead to increased content consumption.</li><li><strong>Mobile-friendly:</strong> Infinite scroll works well on mobile devices, where scrolling is a natural and easy gesture.</li></ul>",
